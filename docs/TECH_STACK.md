# Tech Stack Documentation — Samarthya Portal

## 1. System Architecture Overview
**Samarthya** is an intelligent government scheme matching platform designed to connect special-needs students with welfare schemes. It follows a decoupled, modular architecture featuring a high-performance vanilla frontend, a lightweight Python FastAPI microservice, and offline-capable client storage.

## 2. Frontend Layer
- **Core Structure:** Semantic **HTML5** Single-Page Application (SPA) structure with hash-based view routing.
- **Styling Architecture:** Modular **Vanilla CSS3** leveraging CSS custom properties (Design Tokens), responsive flexbox/grid layouts, and glassmorphism styling.
  - `main.css`: Base variables, ambient glow effects, resets, layout primitives.
  - `components.css`: Buttons, cards, modals, tabs, forms, badges, tooltips.
  - `auth.css` & `admin.css`: Dedicated styling for role auth and administrative panels.
  - `features.css`: Specific styles for OCR upload, NGO camp mode, WhatsApp simulator.
- **JavaScript (Logic & State):** Modular **Vanilla ES6+** without heavy framework overhead for near-instant load times.
- **Typography & Icons:** Google Fonts (`Plus Jakarta Sans`, `Outfit`, `Inter`, `Fira Code`).

## 3. Backend & API Services
- **Runtime & Framework:** **Python 3.14+** running on **FastAPI** with **ASGI (Uvicorn)** server.
- **Data Validation & Serialization:** **Pydantic v2** models enforcing type-safe payloads for student profiles, SC entrepreneur profiles, and scheme matching.
- **Middleware:** `CORSMiddleware` configured for local and production cross-origin resource requests.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/metadata`: Provides Indian states, education levels, disability classifications, and scheme categories.
  - `GET /api/schemes`: Delivers the complete database of state and central welfare schemes.
  - `POST /api/match`: Server-side scoring engine ranking welfare scheme eligibility by age, disability type/percentage, state, and income.
  - `GET /api/credit-schemes`: Delivers the statutory database of NSFDC concessional loan schemes (Term Loan, Micro Finance, Education Loan).
  - `GET /api/channel-partners`: Delivers 25+ channel partner branches (SCAs, PSBs, RRBs) with state and NPA/health filtering.
  - `POST /api/match-credit`: Server-side scoring engine ranking NSFDC credit schemes against entrepreneur criteria (SC certificate, ≤ ₹5.0L income, project cost, sector, and partner availability).

## 4. Data Storage & Persistence
- **Client-Side Database:** **IndexedDB** wrapped with helper layer (`js/db.js`) for storing user profiles, saved scheme bookmarks, application logs, and offline audit trails.
- **Session & Fallback Storage:** `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` for user preferences (theme/contrast), tracked applications, and camp mode batches.
- **Backend Data Source:** Structured `schemes.json` flat-file document store acting as the central knowledge base for both welfare and credit schemes.
